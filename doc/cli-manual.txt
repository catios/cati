DESCRIPTION
       cati    is   a   package   manager   for   UNIX   systems.   cati   can
       install/remove/list and manage packages on system.  also cati can  load
       packages  lists  from  repositories(local  file  repositories  and http
       server repositories).  cati is very simple and easy to use and also  is
       powerful.

       help shows help.

       pkg  work  with .cati packages.  this command is for show/install/build
       package files.  to show package(s), you can run "cati pkg show pkg.cati
       /path/to/anotherpkg.cati"  -f|--files  to  show package files list. for
       example "cati pkg show  somepkg.cati  --files"  another  subcommand  is
       "cati  pkg  install"  "cati  pkg  install somepkg.cati anotherpkg.cati"
       build "cati pkg  build  /path/to/pkgbuild-directory  another-pkg-build-
       dir/".   `pkg  install`  command  has a option named --without-scripts.
       packages has some scripts while install/remove process. in installation
       process,  if  you  don't  want to run scripts, use this option.  --tar‐
       get=[target-path] is other option for  install  command.   this  option
       sets  target  installation path. for example if a package has a file in
       `/usr/bin/myapp`, if you set `/some/dir` value  on  this  option,  that
       file  will be installed in `/some/dir/usr/bin/myapp`.  --keep-conffiles
       is other option.  this option says to cati to keep old version of  Con‐
       fig  files.  config files are a file in package which not be deleted in
       remove process.  also, if you are installing new version of a  package,
       if  conffile  is changed in new version, will be replaced with old ver‐
       sion. if you want to keep old version of  conffile,  use  this  option.
       --force|-f  is a option to force install the package if that is blocked
       in security blacklist.

       list shows list of packages.  with this command you  can  see  list  of
       install/loaded packages list.  "cati list [options]".  this command has
       not argument but has  some  useful  options.   --installed  only  shows
       installed   packages   list.   --installed-manual:  only  shows  Manual
       installed packages list --author=[author-name or  author-nameS  splited
       by  `|`] filters packages list by author name --maintainer=[maintainer-
       name or author-nameS splited by `|`] filters  packages  list  by  main‐
       tainer name --category=[category-name or category-nameS splited by `|`]
       filters packages list by category --search=[word] searches by  packages
       name and description --upgradable shows list of upgradable packages

       remove removes packages. you can remove installed packages by this com‐
       mand. for example "cati remove somepkg".  when you  run  this  command,
       this  asks  you  for continuing process interactive. if you want to say
       Yes non-interactive, you can use -y|--yes option.  "cati remove somepkg
       anotherpkg  -y".   Remember  that  cati  handles dependencies in remove
       process. means if pkga has dependency to  pkgb  and  you  are  removing
       pkgb,  also pkga will be remove because you removing that's dependency.
       also if you want to remove  package  conffiles(config  files  are  some
       files  will not be removed by default), you can use --conffiles option.
       also if you don't want to  run  package  remove  scripts  you  can  use
       --without-scripts  option  (We Suggest do not do this. but maybe useful
       sometimes) also if you want to force remove  Essential  packages(Essen‐
       tial packages are unremovable packages) you can use -f|--force option.

       show  shows  details of packages. for example "cati show somepkg anoth‐
       erpkg".  What's different between pkg show and show ?   actually,  "pkg
       show"  command  shows a package as file, but "show" command shows pack‐
       ages information from repositories package lists.   also  you  can  set
       specify version for packages to show cati show somepkg=1.6.3 anotherpkg
       .  also if you want to see versions  list  of  packages,  you  can  use
       --versions option.  cati show somepkg --versions

       state manages transactions state. what is transactions state? for exam‐
       ple, if you are installing some packages and process  is  in  progress,
       and your computer will be shutdown between the process. cati has a sys‐
       tem named transactions state to continue undoned process in next  boot.
       you  can  manage that with this command.  when you type cati state cati
       shows undoned transactions.  if you want  to  ignore  undoned  transac‐
       tions,  you  can run sudo cati state --abort sudo cati state --complete
       and process will be continued.  also you have -y|--yes option for  non-
       interactive confirmation.

       query checks a package query. what is package queries? package query is
       a string to check a package installation conditions.  for example  pkgx
       >  2.6  is  a  package  query.  this query checks pkgx is installed and
       installed version is upper than 2.6 >=, <, <=, = operations.  this sys‐
       tem  is  used  for package dependencies and conflicts, but also you can
       check them with query command. for example cati query pkga = 1.0

       search search between packages by name  and  description.  for  example
       cati search <something> cati list --search=<something>

       files  shows  files  list  of  packages. for example cati files somepkg
       anotherpkg cati files somepkg anotherpkg=7.3 --installed to  show  list
       of all of installed files on system cati files --installed

       finfo  shows info about an file.  for example cati finfo /path/to/some‐
       file this will show /path/to/somefile file is for which package.

       rdepends shows reverse depends list of packages.  actually  this  shows
       which  packages has dependency to this packages.  for example cati rde‐
       pends somepkg anotherpkg=<specify-version>

       forget forgets packages from packages  list.   actually,  this  command
       deletes  a  package  or specify version of a package from packages list
       database.  cati forget somepkg anotherpkg=<specify-version>

       check checks system health and security. this command  checks  packages
       installation  health,  cati  database and something else. you can check
       you system and packages health and security with this command.  you can
       use  --autofix  option  of this command to automatically fix some prob‐
       lems.

       repo manage repositories. you can list and edit and add cati  reposito‐
       ries.   repositories  are  a  place which cati loads packages list from
       them and installing packages from them.  you can use  -e|--edit  option
       to open repositories config file.  cati repo --edit .  also you can add
       new repo with --add|-a option.  cati repo --add <new-repo> .

       update updates list of available packages from repositories.

       autoremove remove  unused  automaticaly  installed  packages.   if  you
       installed  pkgb  and pkgb has dependency to pkgc and that is installed.
       when you remove pkgb, pkgc is not needed.  this command removes all  of
       automatic  installed  unused(means  not  any installed packages has not
       dependency to that) packages.   you  can  use  all  of  remove  command
       options for this command

       clear-cache clears cache files.  all of files in /var/cache/cati/

       download  download  packages  from repositories.  cati download somepkg
       anotherpkg=<specify-version> .  also you  can  use  --output|-o  option
       cati  download  somepkg  --output=<output-file>  to set downloaded file
       path.

       install installs packages.  for example cati install  pkga  pkgb=<spec‐
       ify-version> .  this command calculates depends and conflicts and down‐
       loads packages from  repositories  and  installs  them.   you  can  use
       -y|--yes option for non-interactive confirmation.  also use --reinstall
       option to reinstall  packages.  for  example  cati  install  pkga  pkgb
       --reinstall .  also you can use --download-only option to only download
       wanted packages.(will not install them and just download in cache) next
       if  you  run  command again, packages already is downloaded and will be
       installed.  you can use this to  download  packages  and  install  them
       later.  also packages has a property named Recommended packages this is
       like depends but will not be installed by default.  you can use --with-
       recommends  option  to  also  install  recommended  packages.  without-
       scripts  option  is  like  `pkg  install  --without-scripts`.    --tar‐
       get=[path]  option  is  like  `pkg install --target`.  --keep-conffiles
       option is like `pkg install --keep-conffiles`

       upgrade upgrade all of packages. this command upgrades all of installed
       packages  to latest available version.  you can use all of install com‐
       mand options for this command.

       full-upgrade update, upgrade and autoremove system
